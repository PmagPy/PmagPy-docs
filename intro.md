# PmagPy: An open source package for paleomagnetic data analysis

PmagPy is a set of tools written in Python for the analysis of paleomagnetic data. It facilitates interpretation of demagnetization data, paleointensity data, and data from other types of rock magnetic experiments. PmagPy can be used to create a wide variety of useful plots. It is designed to work with the MagIC database (https://earthref.org/MagIC), allowing manipulation of downloaded data sets as well as preparation of new contributions for uploading to the MagIC database. It also supports the use of Jupyter notebooks for fully documented and nicely illustrated data analysis.

This documentation is organized into a few major sections.

- **Tutorials** are step-by-step introductory guides to Jupyter Book.
- **Topic Guides** cover specific areas in more depth, and are organized as discrete "how-to" sections.
- **Reference** sections describe the API/syntax/etc of Jupyter Book in detail.

üåç About our team

^^^

The code base for the PmagPy project has been built up over the years by Lisa Tauxe (<a href="https://github.com/ltauxe" class="user-mention">@ltauxe</a>; Professor Emrita at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography) and by Nicholas Swanson-Hysell (<a href="https://github.com/swanson-hysell" class="user-mention">@swanson-hysell</a>; Associate Professor at UC Berkeley) supported by grants from the National Science Foundation. Lori Jonestrask (<a href="https://github.com/moonshoes87" class="user-mention">@moonshoes87</a>) and Ron Shaar (<a href="https://github.com/ronshaar" class="user-mention">@ronshaar</a>, Senior Lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem) have made substantial contributions to the project as have others in the [open community of contributors](https://github.com/pmagpy/pmagpy/graphs/contributors). You too can become a contributor by putting in a pull request.
