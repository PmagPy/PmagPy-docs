# PmagPy: An open source package for paleomagnetic data analysis

PmagPy is a set of tools written in Python for the analysis of paleomagnetic data. It facilitates interpretation of demagnetization data, paleointensity data, and data from other types of rock magnetic experiments. The package is hosted on Github (https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy) and can be installed via PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/pmagpy/). PmagPy can be used to create a wide variety of useful plots. It is designed to work with the MagIC database (https://earthref.org/MagIC), allowing manipulation of downloaded data sets as well as preparation of new contributions for uploading to the MagIC database. It also supports the use of Jupyter notebooks for fully documented and nicely illustrated data analysis.

PmagPy is comprised of:

- **Function modules for paleomagnetic data analysis** Function modules include that for paleomagnetic data analysis (pmagpy.pmag) and plotting (pmagpy.pmagplotlib) as well as interactive higher level data analysis (pmagpy.ipmag). The functions within these modules are at the heart of the GUI and command line programs. With pmagpy in the python path (which can be accomplished through pip installation ```pip install pmagpy```), these modules can be imported (e.g. ```import pmagpy.ipmag as ipmag```).
- **A graphical user interface (GUI) program** The PmagPy application enables users to get data into the MagIC database format as well as analyze demagnetization and paleointensity data.
- **Command line programs** The PmagPy command line programs enable all sorts of  paleomagnetic data analysis and wrangling. They are contained within the programs folder of the PmagPy repository (https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy) and can be pip installed (```pip install pmagpy-cli```).

üåç About our team

^^^

The code base for the PmagPy project has been built up over the years by Lisa Tauxe (<a href="https://github.com/ltauxe" class="user-mention">@ltauxe</a>; Professor Emrita at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography) and by Nicholas Swanson-Hysell (<a href="https://github.com/swanson-hysell" class="user-mention">@swanson-hysell</a>; Associate Professor at UC Berkeley) supported by grants from the National Science Foundation. Lori Jonestrask (<a href="https://github.com/moonshoes87" class="user-mention">@moonshoes87</a>) and Ron Shaar (<a href="https://github.com/ronshaar" class="user-mention">@ronshaar</a>, Senior Lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem) have made substantial contributions to the project as have others in the [open community of contributors](https://github.com/pmagpy/pmagpy/graphs/contributors). You too can become a contributor by putting in a pull request.
