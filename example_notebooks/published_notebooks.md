Tauxe et al. 2016 üìì
PmagPy Examples
^^^

This notebook published with the paper on PmagPy illustrates some of the capabilities of PmagPy to analyze paleodirectional data, conduct statistical tests, and calculate paleomagnetic poles.

Inclination shallowing
^^^

This notebook analyzes data from a Mesoproterozoic sandstone and applies a new approach to provide elliptical pole position uncertainty associated with inclination shallowing that incorporates output from the elongation-inclination method (*external link to Github*).

Paleomagnetic sampling strategy design
^^^

This JupyterBook includes notebooks to evaluate different sampling strategies for estimating paleomagnetic poles and paleosecular variation of the magnetic field based on site magnetizations. (*external link to Paleosampling JupyterBook*).
