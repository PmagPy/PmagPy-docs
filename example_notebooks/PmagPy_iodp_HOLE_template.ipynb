    "- Import the required python packages and set up the desired directory structure for each HOLE. \n",
    "- Download the Section Summary table and put the .csv file in the HOLE working directory\n",
    "- Download the Sample Report table for any discrete samples taken (select Sample Type - CUBE and Test code PMAG) and put them in the HOLE working directory\n",
    "- Download the SRM data for the hole and put them in the SRM working directory in the HOLE working directory \n",
    "- Download the SRM discrete measurement data for the hole and put them in the SRM_discrete sample working directory.\n",

    "    - switch the login profile to scientist and login with OES credentials (user name/email password)\n",
    "    - choose scientist and map the drives.  they should be now available to windows explorer\n",
    "    - copy to your HOLE working directory.  \n",
