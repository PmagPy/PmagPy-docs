    "**PmagPy** is a software package for analyzing paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data using Python. These notebooks demonstrate how to use **PmagPy** in a Jupyter notebook or Python script.  For examples of how to use PmagPy scripts on the command line, see the static version of [**PmagPy\\_cli**](https://pmagpy.github.io/PmagPy-cli.html).  If you are running this notebook locally, you can click the following link to launch [**PmagPy-cli.ipynb**](PmagPy-cli.ipynb)\n",
