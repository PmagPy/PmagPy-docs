PmagPy Examples
^^^

This notebook published with the paper on PmagPy illustrates some of the capabilities of PmagPy to analyze paleodirectional data, conduct statistical tests, and calculate paleomagnetic poles.

Inclination shallowing
^^^

This notebook analyzes data from a Mesoproterozoic sandstone and applies a new approach to provide elliptical pole position uncertainty associated with inclination shallowing that incorporates output from the elongation-inclination method (*external link to Github*).
